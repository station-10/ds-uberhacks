* [Yellowbrick Repo](https://github.com/DistrictDataLabs/yellowbrick)

### 7. Shap
AI Explainability
* [Shap Repo](https://github.com/slundberg/shap)

### 8. Fairlearn
Non-discriminatory AI.
* [Fairlearn Repo](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn)

### 9. Metaflow
Easy Pipelines.
* [Metaflow site](https://metaflow.org)

### 10. Make
CLI maker-easier.
* [Make site](https://www.gnu.org/software/make)

#### Usage
1. Check the Makefile in this repo - it contains some basic recipes for creating a conda 
environment and running a main.py file, but you can add stuff like Docker, Cloud tasks etc. 
to it... Anything and everything involving the CLI.
2. The Makefile is linked to the `.env` file. If you specify a variable in the .env, Make will
read it and use it.
3. Using Make is simple: `make <command>`. You can type `make help` or just `make` for a list 
of commands.
4. For the `create-environment` command, Make will install everything in `requirements-conda.txt`
and then everything in `requirements-pip.txt`
5. I've recently stopped trying to `conda install` anything. The general consensus is that it's 
broken due to the length of time it takes solving environments and such. As such, all requirements 
are in the `requirements-pip.txt` file. I'll still use `conda` as my package manager because it's
interoperable with cloud platforms and MLFlow, but yeah `conda install` sucks now. I hope they
find a way to fix it ðŸ˜«.
6. Feel free to use this Makefile and setup as a base. I can't claim credit for it. I stole the
Makefile from [Yuxiang Gong's tutorial](https://medium.com/@ygong/create-virtualenv-for-data-science-projects-with-one-command-only-7bec3548419f)
which is also probably a good place to start for learning more about it. 
7. Remember... Make is pre-installed on linux, available via XCode on mac and via choco on Windows!
